# Astrophysical Biases of Galaxy Populations

This is a Python + Mathematica code used to constrain magnification and evolution biases using the multipoles of the galaxy 2-point correlation function in the flat-sky approximation. We make use of the three even multipoles and two odd multipoles containing all the information available. This code includes for the first time the modeling both of the dipole and the octupole as predicted by General Relativity, and exploits them simultaneously to put constraints on the magnification and the evolution biases, using solely information from the large-scale distribution of galaxies. 

This code was designed by [D. Sobral-Blanco](https://github.com/dasobral) to provide the numerical support to the paper [Using relativistic effects in large-scale structure to constrain astrophysical properties of galaxy populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19908). Any comment or inquiry should be adressed to [D. Sobral-Blanco](https://github.com/dasobral).
